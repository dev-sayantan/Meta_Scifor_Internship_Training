    "Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics are two branches of statistical analysis that serve different purposes.\n",

    "Descriptive statistics involves the organization, summarization, and presentation of data. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Common measures used in descriptive statistics include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation), and measures of distribution (skewness, kurtosis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, involves making inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It uses the data collected from a sample to make inferences or predictions about a population. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses and make generalizations about a population based on the results observed in a sample. Common techniques in inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis."
